    "\n",
    "__Method__<br>\n",
    "KNN regression would be appropriate to answer the question as we are predicting a numeric variable. The relationship appears to be non-linear from *Time Playing in the Server vs Age of the Player* graph, so KNN was chosen over regression as it captures non-linear patterns. <br>\n",
    "__Assumptions and Limitations__<br>\n",
    "It will be assumed that the other variables (subscription status and experience level) are correlated with time playing in the server. Because we are including non-numeric variables, other methods may need to be used to implement experience and subscription into the model. Additionally, the variables would have to be scaled as KNN is distance-based. Outliers in the dataset will also diminish the effectiveness of the model. <br>\n",
    "__Comparing and Selecting The Model__<br>\n",
    "The models will be compared and selected using the number of neighbors to use __(k)__. The k-value which produces the smallest RMSE value will be selected. <br>\n",
    "__Data Processing__\n",
    "Player experience level could be used by assigning a number from 1-5 for each increasing player experience level, respectively. For subscription status, a dummy variable can be used as it is binary(0/1). All predictor variables will be scaled and the data will be split between 70% training and 30% testing sets. The training set will then be tuned using 5-fold cross validation to pick the k value which produces the lowest RMSE. The final model will then be evaluated using the test set to test its accuracy."
